# A user might:
# 1. Answer the question                                      [x] -> regular story flow
# 2. Ask the chatbot the question back                        [x] -> done via retriaval intent
# 3. Engage in chitchat that diverges from the questionnaire  [ ] -  need to collect real user responses for that
# 4. Not understand the question and/or ask for clarification [x] -> done via survey yaml file and rule
# 5. Dodge the question: Not want to answer the question.     [x] -> handled via deny intent
# 6. Dodge the question: Ask "Why do you want to know?"       [x] -> done via yaml file and rule
# 7. (not know how to answer a question | no information)     [x] -> handled via deny intent

# Dynamic delay of chatbot utterances/responses [nope] - needs to be solved in front-end due to Lock Store mechanism
  # Messages are sent after the agent (chatbot) is done with all actions (caused by user input) and releases the lock

# Handle fallback behaviour (https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/fallback-handoff/):
  # Low Action Confidence Fallback [x] -> asks to rephrase
  # NLU confidence Fallback        [x] -> Advanced single-stage-fallback
  # Two-Stage-Fallback bugged in Rasa 3.1.x

# Train the survey chatbot: rasa train --augmentation 0
# --> don't need/want data augmentation for the way the survey chatbot is designed
